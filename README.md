# OpenCV Basics

## Overview
This repository is designed to help you build a strong foundation in OpenCV, one of the most powerful computer vision libraries.  
Through practical examples and simple projects, you will learn how to handle images, videos, and apply essential transformations.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)

Install via pip:
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

---

## Notes
- Example images (`img.jpg`, `newspaper.jpg`, etc.) and videos (`video.mp4`, `output.avi`) are provided for practice.
- This repository is ideal for beginners who want to solidify their basic OpenCV skills before moving into advanced topics like object detection, segmentation, and deep learning-based vision models.
